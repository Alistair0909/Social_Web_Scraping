# Tonik's Boring Stack 🥱

Welcome to the Tonik's Boring Stack, a foundation-focused toolkit built on top of [create-t3-turbo](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo) with additional features and opinionated choices. This stack emphasizes robust architecture while maintaining rapid development capabilities, perfect for projects that need to move fast but grow reliably. While [create-t3-turbo](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo) provides an excellent foundation, we've enhanced it with additional tools and practices specifically chosen to support scalable MVP development without compromising on production-readiness.

Built with offline-first principles and seamless deployment workflows, it supports ephemeral environments through Supabase branching and Vercel preview deployments. The stack includes comprehensive end-to-end testing with Playwright, ensuring your applications remain reliable as they evolve.

Whether you need a lean setup for a quick prototype or a feature-rich application, our prepared Turbo generators allow you to extend the stack precisely to your needs with [optional features](#optional-features). Get started with a solid foundation that grows with your project, from MVP to production-ready application.

## Scripts

### Everyday usage

- `pnpm dev`: Starts the development server.
- `pnpm lint:fix`: Fixes all auto-fixable errors using eslint.
- `pnpm typecheck`: Checks types validity using typescript
- `pnpm format:fix`: Formats code with prettier.
- `pnpm e2e:ui`: Starts Playwright in UI mode. Requires development server to run in parallel.
- `pnpm test`: Run SQL db tests written in `supabase/tests`. This resets DB so all local data will be lost. To run tests without resetting DB use `pnpm db:test`.

### Specific workflows

- `pnpm generate:types`: Update Supabase types and Payload CMS types if enabled
- `pnpm generate:importmap`: Updates import map for Payload CMS if enabled
- `pnpm ui-add`: Add new Shadcn UI component
- `pnpm db:reset`: Reset the local Supabase database and run seed scripts 
- `pnpm supabase [...]`: Run supabase CLI commands. For example, `pnpm supabase migraton new` to pull the database from Supabase.

### Useful Supabase commands
- `pnpm supabase diff -f migration_name -s payload,public,storage`: Generate a migration from the current state of the database. Useful for generating migrations after changing the schema with Payload CMS.

### Cleanup scripts

- `pnpm clean`: Remove root node_modules
- `pnpm clean:workspaces`: Run clean script for all workspaces. It removes node_modules, dist folders, caches, etc.
